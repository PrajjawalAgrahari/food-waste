Here’s a feature‑set roadmap you can consider for a Food‑Waste‑Management platform built on ReactJS (UI) + Spring Boot (API) + Elasticsearch (search & analytics):

---

## 1. **Core Donation/Request Workflow**  
- **Surplus Listing**  
  - Donors can post available food items (name, quantity, expiry date, pickup location, photos).  
  - Simple form with validation (e.g. expiry > today).  
- **Requesting & Matching**  
  - Recipients browse or search listings, submit “I want this” requests.  
  - Auto‑match donors ↔ recipients and send notifications. ❌
- **Collection Scheduling**  
  - Calendar widget to pick preferred pickup slots.  
  - Integration with Google/Microsoft Calendar APIs.  

## 2. **Geolocation & Mapping**  
- **Map View**  
  - Show nearby surplus listings on an interactive map.  
  - Clustering of nearby items. ❌ 
- **Geo‑distance Queries**  
  - Elasticsearch geo‑filter to “Find food within X km.” ❌
- **Route Optimization**  
  - For volunteer drivers or charities collecting multiple donations. ❌
- **Community Fridge Locations**
  - Map of local fridges with real‑time inventory. ❌

## 3. **Powerful Search & Filtering (Elasticsearch)**  
- **Full‑Text Search**  
  - Search by food name, description, tags (e.g. “bread”, “vegetarian,” “kosher”).  
- **Faceted Navigation**  
  - Filters for expiry date ranges, categories (produce, dairy, baked goods), donor types.  
- **Autocomplete & “Did you mean?”**  
  - As‑you‑type suggestions, fuzzy matching (“sald” → “salad”).  
- **Boosting & Synonyms**  
  - Give priority to items expiring sooner; define synonyms (“tomato” ≈ “tomatoes”).  

## 4. **Notifications & Alerts**  
- **Email / SMS / Push**  
  - Alerts when a matching listing appears.  
  - Reminders for scheduled pickups.  
- **Low‑Stock Warning**  
  - Notify charities when their “inventory” of rescued food is low.  
- **Expiry Alerts**  
  - Flag items nearing expiry so they get prioritized.  

## 5. **User & Role Management**  
- **Donor / Recipient / Admin Roles**  
  - Custom dashboards per role.  
- **Verification & Rating**  
  - Allow recipients to rate donors and vice versa (trust network).  

## 6. **Analytics & Reporting**  
- **Waste‑Reduction Metrics**  
  - Total kilograms saved over time, by category or region.  
- **Dashboards**  
  - Charts (React + Recharts or D3) showing trend lines, heat maps.  
- **Daily/Weekly Digest**  
  - Automated summary emails with key stats.  

## 7. **Recipe & Meal‑Planner Integration**  
- **Recipe Suggestions**  
  - Based on donated items (e.g. “You have zucchinis & tomatoes → suggest ratatouille”).  
- **Nutritional Calculator**  
  - Estimate calories/nutrients from rescued food.  

## 8. **Gamification & Incentives**  
- **Points & Badges**  
  - Reward donors/volunteers for milestones (e.g. 10 donations).  
- **Leaderboard**  
  - Top rescuers/collectors in the community.  

## 9. **Mobile‑First Responsive UI**  
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)**  
  - Offline listing caching; installable on home screen.  
- **QR Codes**  
  - Generate for listing pickup locations.  

## 10. **Advanced Integrations**  
- **Slack/Discord Bots**  
  - Post new listings into community channels.  
- **Machine‑Learning Tagging**  
  - Auto‑classify food type from images (TensorFlow.js).  
- **IoT Fridge Monitoring**  
  - Integrate with smart “community fridge” sensors to auto‑update inventory.

### Tech Highlights with ElasticSearch  
- **Geo‑Distance Queries** for “Items near me.”  
- **Aggregations** for your dashboards (e.g. sum of weights by category).  
- **Per‑colleague access control** via document‑level security (dls) for multi‑tenant deployments.  

Pick and choose from the above based on scope. You can start with the core Donation/Request workflow + basic search & filtering, then layer on mapping, notifications, analytics, and finally advanced AI/IoT features. Good luck building!
